/*
You are given a number n. You need to find the digital root of n. Digital Root of a number is the recursive sum of its digits until we get a single digit number.

Examples :

Input: n = 1
Output:  1
Explanation: Digital root of 1 is 1
Input: n = 99999
Output: 9
Explanation: Sum of digits of 99999 is 45 which is not a single digit number, hence sum of digit of 45 is 9 which is a single digit number.
Constraints:
1 ≤ n ≤ 107

    int digitalRoot(int N) {
        
        int root;
        
        if (N == 0) root = 0;
        else if (N % 9 == 0) root = 9;
        else root = N % 9;
        
        if (root == 2 || root == 3 || root == 5 || root == 7)
            return 1;

            return 0;
