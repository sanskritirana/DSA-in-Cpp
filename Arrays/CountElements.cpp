/*
You are given an integer array nums of length n and an integer k.

An element in nums is said to be qualified if there exist at least k elements in the array that are strictly greater than it.

Return an integer denoting the total number of qualified elements in nums.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,1,2], k = 1

Output: 2

Explanation:

The elements 1 and 2 each have at least k = 1 element greater than themselves.
​​​​​​​No element is greater than 3. Therefore, the answer is 2.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [5,5,5], k = 2

Output: 0

Explanation:

Since all elements are equal to 5, no element is greater than the other. Therefore, the answer is 0.

 

Constraints:

1 <= n == nums.length <= 105
1 <= nums[i] <= 109
0 <= k < n

class Solution {
public:
    int countElements(vector<int>& nums, int k) {

        int n = nums.size();

        sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());

        int count = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {

            int greater = nums.end() - upper_bound(nums.begin(), nums.end(), nums[i]);

            if (greater >= k) {
                count++;
            }
        }

        return count;
    }
};
